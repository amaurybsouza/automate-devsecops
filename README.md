# Awesome DevSecOps   [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Inspired by the awesome-* trend on GitHub. This is a collection of documents, presentations, videos, training materials, tools, services and general leadership that support the DevSecOps mission. These are the essential building blocks and tidbits that can help you to arrange for a DevSecOps experiment or to help you build out your own DevSecOps program.

This list will not be fully comprehensive and will change as DevSecOps matures. We intend for it to be an awesome list that grows and changes as the community learns and improves how DevSecOps is implemented and adopted. To be included in this list, the information, tools, vendors or initiative must provide for Free or Open Source capabilities that help with the DevSecOps mission. Links that lead to a commercial aspect are noted with a (P).
