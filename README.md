# Awesome DevSecOps   [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Inspired by the awesome-* trend on GitHub. This is a collection of documents, presentations, videos, training materials, tools, services and general leadership that support the DevSecOps mission. These are the essential building blocks and tidbits that can help you to arrange for a DevSecOps experiment or to help you build out your own DevSecOps program.

This list will not be fully comprehensive and will change as DevSecOps matures. We intend for it to be an awesome list that grows and changes as the community learns and improves how DevSecOps is implemented and adopted. To be included in this list, the information, tools, vendors or initiative must provide for Free or Open Source capabilities that help with the DevSecOps mission. Links that lead to a commercial aspect are noted with a (P).

## Manifesto
Through Security as Code, we have and will learn that there is simply a better way for security practitioners, like us, to operate and contribute value with less friction. We know we must adapt our ways quickly and foster innovation to ensure data security and privacy issues are not left behind because we were too slow to change.

## Presentations
Many talks are now targeting the change of adding Security into the DevOps environment. I would like to share some of the most expressive talks.

# DevSecOps Tools
This collection of tools are useful in establishing a DevSecOps platform. We have divided the tools into several categories that help with the different divisions of DevSecOps.

## Secret Management
To support security as code, sensitive credentials and secrets need to be managed, security, maintained and rotated using automation.

- [Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/pt/products/vault)
- [Conjur](https://www.conjur.org/use-cases/ci-cd-pipelines/)

## Continuous Integration & Delivery
Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams.
